Kaggle's competition for using Google's word2vec package for sentiment analysis

## Installation

There're some requirements for making the stuff work. Use `pip` to install them easily:

```bash
$> sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data

The training data (labeled and unlabeled both) are too large to attach to the github so have been provided at 

https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial/download/labeledTrainData.tsv.zip
https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial/download/testData.tsv.zip
https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial/download/unlabeledTrainData.tsv.zip

Please note, this will require creating a valid kaggle ID. After the data has been downloaded to Code/data/ folder, unzip these to their respective tsv files
